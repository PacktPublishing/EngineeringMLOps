This is the code repository for [Engineering MLOps](https://www.packtpub.com/product/engineering-mlops/9781800562882), published by Packt.

**Rapidly build, test, and manage production-ready machine learning life cycles at scale**

## What is this book about?
MLOps is a systematic approach to building, deploying, and monitoring machine learning (ML) solutions. It is an engineering discipline that can be applied to various industries and use cases. This book presents comprehensive insights into MLOps coupled with real-world examples to help you to write programs, train robust and scalable ML models, and build ML pipelines to train and deploy models securely in production.
This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Formulate data governance strategies and pipelines for ML training and deployment
* Get to grips with implementing ML pipelines, CI/CD pipelines, and ML monitoring pipelines
* Design a robust and scalable microservice and API for test and production environments
* Curate your custom CD processes for related use cases and organizations
* Monitor ML models, including monitoring data drift, model drift, and application performance
* Build and maintain automated ML systems

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter06.

The code will look like the following:
```
ws = Workspace.from_config()
model1 = Model(ws, 'support-vector-classifier')
model2 = Model(ws, 'scaler')
service = Model.deploy(workspace=ws,
                       name='weatherprediction',
                       models=[model1, model2],
                       inference_config=inference_config,
                       deployment_config=aciconfig)
service.wait_for_deployment(show_output=True)

```
